# Data-Merger

This system is used in scenarios where data from multiple spacecraft (or other distributed systems) needs to be received, processed, and combined into a single stream for further analysis or storage. It's ideal for applications in satellite telemetry, space exploration, or other fields where data from multiple sources must be aggregated and processed in real time.
